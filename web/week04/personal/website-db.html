                The following diagram explains the design of the database for the Magic: The Gathering website.

                As shown above, the database will feature several tables with a few lookup tables. One of 
                the most important tables is the <span class="text-color-blue">multiverse_lookup</span>
                table. This table will house the multiverse id for cards added by users either through 
                "saving" the card to their account or by adding the card to a deck. This multiverse id comes 
                from the API endpoints offered by Wizards of the Coast, the creators of Magic: The Gathering.
            </div>
            <div class="explanation">
                These API Endpoints are used in order to query the database housing the list of cards in 
                the realm of the game. The following is an example of the response JSON of
                a query for the card pictured on the right. A plethora of information is returned from 
                the GET request, including all details given on the card as well as various versions of 
                the card in different languages.

                In order to create the database structured above, the following sql code will be implemented.
            </div>
            <pre id="sqlCode">

                User passwords will be hashed server-side using the 
                <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.hash.php">sha256</a> method. This method uses 
                several different methods of cryptography to mess with plaintext to make it extremely well hashed.
                Try out the example below.
            </div>
            <div id="hashContainer">
                <button id="hashButton" onclick="createUserHash()">Create Hash</button>
                <input id="userInput" type="text" placeholder="Text to be hashed">
                <div id="hashed"></div>
            </div>
