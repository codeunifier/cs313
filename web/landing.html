            <img id="sitesLogo" src="images/sites.png" class="image">
            <p>I work for Sites USA, a company that develops web-based tools and services for commercial real estate.
                Our interface features mapping, demographics, and analysis. In my experience with the company, I've 
                been in charge of developing the front-end interface and maintaining unit, api, and end-to-end tests. 
                I've been able to utilize my knowledge of C#, C++, and SQL queries while picking up skills in Javascript, 
                Angular, and advanced CSS styling.</p>
            <p>We've worked on several projects that have really strengthened my programming and design skills. Even 
                though I'm still new to programming in the workplace, my boss really likes what I've done so far and 
                has given me many opportunities to stretch and learn more. He has a tendency to throw us in the refiner's 
                fire to learn by doing.
